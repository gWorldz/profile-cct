== Description ==

This plugin allows for management of user public profiles with a lot of customizability.

In the dashboard under Profiles->Settings, administrators can:

* Build a form for users to fill out, choosing which fields to include and how to arrange them, 
	via a straightforward drag and drop interface.
* Add taxonomies to group and filter profiles
* Design a page to display user information
* Design a separate list view when listing multiple users
* Create additional fields that can be added to the profile form and page.
* Manage, create and delete user profiles

Users can edit their profile under Users->Public Profile, where they'll be presented with
the form you created.

Everything can be styled with CSS
